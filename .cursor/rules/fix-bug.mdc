# Fix a Bug

## 1. Triage & Analysis

1. Understand the bug — what is broken, expected behavior, steps to reproduce.
2. Locate the relevant module/file in `src/modules/` or `src/common/`.

## 2. Branch Setup

```bash
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
git checkout -b fix/[bug-description]
```

## 3. Reproduce (TDD)

1. Write a failing test in `src/__tests__/` that reproduces the bug.
2. Run the test and confirm it **fails** — this proves the bug exists.

## 4. Fix Implementation

1. Analyze root cause in the source code.
2. Apply a minimal, focused fix — avoid scope creep.
3. Run the reproduction test and confirm it **passes**.

## 5. Regression Testing

Run full validation to ensure nothing else broke:

```bash
npm run validate  # lint + format:check + test:coverage + build
```

100% coverage must still pass after the fix.

## 6. Finalize

1. Commit with Conventional Commits: `fix(scope): description`
   - Example: `fix(auth): handle null token in login flow`
2. Push and create PR targeting `develop`
3. Squash merge after approval
