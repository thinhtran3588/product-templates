# Review a Pull Request

## 1. Context

1. Review the PR title/description — must follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).
2. Check that acceptance criteria are listed.
3. Verify CI checks pass (lint, test, build).

## 2. Code Review Checklist

### Functionality & Logic

- [ ] Completeness: meets the requirements
- [ ] Correctness: no logical errors or missed edge cases
- [ ] Security: no exposed secrets, unvalidated inputs
- [ ] Performance: no obvious bottlenecks (N+1 queries, large loops)

### Quality & Style

- [ ] Follows [Coding Conventions](landing-page/docs/coding-conventions.md) (kebab-case, Clean Architecture layers)
- [ ] Code is modular, DRY, and readable
- [ ] Tests included with 100% coverage maintained
- [ ] No `"use client"` higher than necessary

### Frontend Specific

- [ ] UI matches design specs (colors, spacing, typography)
- [ ] Responsive — mobile and desktop cases handled

## 3. Feedback

- **Request Changes**: Logic errors, security flaws, or missing tests (blockers).
- **Comment**: Minor polish or refactoring (mark as "Nitpick").
- **Approve**: Code meets all standards — "LGTM!"

## 4. Merge

If approved: **Squash and Merge** to target branch with a clean commit message.
